"""normalize workspaces.kind to the supported set

Revision ID: 072
Revises: 071
Create Date: 2026-08-12

Renumbered from upstream's 068 to 072 when merging upstream/main into this
fork — 068 was already taken here by an unrelated fork-only migration
(asset_income).

`kind` is now two values, personal and business. The three retired ones
all described work rather than a household, so they fold into
`business`:

  - `freelancer` and `small_business` split work by size, which the data
    model never acted on.
  - `accountant_firm` described an edge between two workspaces, not an
    attribute of one, and that relationship is already carried by
    `workspaces.managed_by_user_id`.

The column has no DB-level constraint, so without this a row would keep
reading back a kind the app no longer offers. Data-only, and a no-op on
most installs: the retired values were never selectable in the UI.
